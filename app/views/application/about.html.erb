    <p><img src="/images/cyborg-badgers.png" alt="Cyborg Badgers" align="left" style="padding: 0 5px 5px 0;" />Safehood was put together by Cyborg Badgers: Aaron Bannert, Alan Palazzolo, Karen Rustad, Michelle Koeth, and Talin Salway. We developed it for the Neighborhood Watch on Michelle and Talin's block in Oakland, CA as part of <a href="http://hackforchange.com/">Hack for Change</a>, a 24-hour hackathon organized by Change.org.<p>
